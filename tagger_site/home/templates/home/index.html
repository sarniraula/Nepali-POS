  <h1>Nepali Part-of-Speech(POS) Tagging</h1>
<p>In corpus linguistics, part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging or POST), also called grammatical tagging or word-category disambiguation, is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its contextâ€”i.e., its relationship with adjacent and related words in a phrase, sentence, or paragraph.
</p>
<p>Proper part-of-speech tagging has great importance in various field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) such as machine translation, information extraction, word sense disambiguation, speech recognition and others. It is also useful during the preprocessing step of parsing a s the unique tag to each word reduces the number of parses.</p>
